//for loop = repeat some code a certain amount of times, prolly limited than the while and do loops which is infinite

//count one to one million
//for (initialization ; condition ; update +=1 or ++) uncomment code below


/*for (i = 1; i <= 1000000; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}*/


//or you can also decrement with the for loop
for (let i = 10000; i > 0; i--) {
  console.log(i);
}
console.log("loop done!");
